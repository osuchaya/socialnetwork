## Description 
Since this is a back-end application, please visit the walkthrough video at []()
This project is part of Module 18 NoSQL where MongoDB was used as database whose advantage is its speed and ability to handle large amounts of data and allowing flexibility for unstructured data. This project is to build an API for a social network web application employing Express.js for routing, MongoDB for database and Mongoose as the Object Document Modeller (ODM). As it is an application that needs timestamp, day.js library was employed to generate and deliver this.

## Installation and Usage
This application requires the installation of Node version 16.0 in order to run successfully. Please ensure to have the following npm packages installed via Node Package Management (npm): Express, Day.js, Mongoose and optionally, NoDemon. Then run the server.js file by typing ```node server.js``` in Command Line Interface (CLI) or ```npm start```.

## Learning Points

The author has learnt to use another database structure, namely, No SQL called MongoDB which is different to MySQL in the sense that it allows for non-relational database and for holding unstructured data. Instead of Sequelize, in this module, we used Mongoose which acts as Object Document Modeller and rather than 'tables', objects are stored as 'documents'. The API routes also look different compared to SQL databases and chaining is allowed. The successful routing is tested via Insomnia REST API. The author has learned to work with a useful and widely use database back-end employed by large companies such as Facebook (Meta).

## Credits
Resources were consulted to complete this application such as the documentations on MongoDB, Mongoose, particularly on validation. Day.js documentation was also consulted for the timestamp function. With additional help of tutor, this project completion was made possible.
